# Rust Learning Repository

This repository serves as a learning resource for Rust programming language. Here, I will be documenting my progress as I explore the various concepts and features of Rust.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to:

- Learn Rust programming language
- Document my advances and learning journey
- Share my code and projects with others


## Contents

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Progress](#progress)

## Getting Started

To get started with Rust, you can follow the official Rust documentation and tutorials available at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Additionally, this repository will contain code examples, exercises, and projects that I will be working on.

## Progress

I will be updating this README file regularly to track my progress and document the concepts I have learned. You can find the details of my progress in the [Progress](./PROGRESS.md) file.
