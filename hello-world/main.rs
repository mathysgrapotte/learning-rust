fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// Rust comments start with two slashes and continue to the end of the line.
// The lines above define a function names main, this function is special as it is the entry point of the program. This function in our case has no parameters () and returns nothing ->.
// the println function prints something to the console. The fact that it ends with a ! means that it is a macro, not a function. (see later)
// The line ends with ; significating the end of the statement. 

// Since Rust is a compiled language, we need to compile the code with the rustc command before running it like any other executable.
